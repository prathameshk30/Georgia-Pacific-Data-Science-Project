# Georgia-Pacific-Data-Science-Project
## Internship Project

Designing a complete Machine Learning pipeline and deploying in local production for analysts end users. Building pipeline using Python, Tableau, AWS Sagemaker & AWS S3. Project consisted of working on structured marketing data of ‘Kroger’ and constructing regional prescriptive models (Elastic-Net & Ridge regression) using mix marketing model (MMM). Algorithms helped to analyze pricing and assortment strategy for predicted sales of GP products using pricing elasticity. Used PCA and developed a weekly rolling pricing algorithm in feature engineering. Up to 50 models made in pipeline with R2 score ranging from 0.68-0.94

## Key Technologies used:-

Python (selenium, ETL)

AWS Sagemaker

AWS S3

Tableau

## ML Pipeline Architecture
